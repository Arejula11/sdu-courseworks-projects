# 🎓 SDU Software Engineering Portfolio

This repository serves as a central hub for the academic projects I contributed to during my **Master Degree in  Software Engineering** at the **University of Southern Denmark (SDU)**.

The projects listed here span coursework, practical assignments, and collaborative initiatives developed throughout the degree. While many are hosted in my personal GitHub repositories, others are managed by classmates or university organizations.


Each entry includes a brief description and a link to the corresponding repository, where you can explore the code, documentation, and additional resources.

> ℹ️ Please note: Not every subject has an associated repository, as some projects were not hosted on GitHub or were submitted as part of group work managed by others.
